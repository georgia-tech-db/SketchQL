# SketchQL: Video Moment Querying with a Visual Query Interface

Sketch-QL is a video database management system for retrieving video moments with a sketch-based query interface.This interface allows users to specify object trajectory events with simple mouse drag-and-drop operations. Using a pre-trained model that encodes trajectory similarity, Sketch-QL achieves zero-shot video moments retrieval by performing similarity searches over the video to identify clips that are the most similar to the visual query.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Setup Environment
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Install FFmpeg (for video processing)
```bash
# MacOS
brew install ffmpeg

# Ubuntu/Debian
apt install ffmpeg
```

### üì• Data Preparation
1. Download Dataset: Download the traffic dataset from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DIy0NOBPTnRaDsnqSl-o1e3vAeFfM3Kz/view?usp=sharing) and place it in the `data/videos/` folder.


2. Download Model Checkpoint: Download the pre-trained model from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MnsQj0xyvVAm87dST1Tmn7_ackWfiLXz/view?usp=sharing) and place it in the `data/model_checkpoint` folder.

## üöÄ Usage

We provide two sample queries `car_left_turn` (Q1.1) and `carstop_personwalk` (Q1.3) for the VIRAT dataset. These sample queries can be viewed at `output/queries/`.

Run the main pipeline: 
```bash
python3 pipeline.py

```
The retrieved video clips are saved under `output/query_results/`
